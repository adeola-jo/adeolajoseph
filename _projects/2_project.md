This project involves implementing and comparing multiple deep learning architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers) for melanoma detection, achieving 89.7% sensitivity and 85.3% specificity, exceeding published benchmarks by 7%.

I developed custom data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and improve model performance on limited medical datasets. This research contributes to improved early detection of skin cancer.
