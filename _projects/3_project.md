I developed a real-time SLAM system combining EKF with ICP scan-matching for Kobuki Turtlebot. This system achieved centimeter-level mapping accuracy in indoor environments through optimized feature extraction and data association algorithms.

The implementation handles sensor fusion between 2D LiDAR and IMU data while maintaining real-time performance on resource-constrained systems.
