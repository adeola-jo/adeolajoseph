I developed a desktop application using React, Electron, and Vite for efficient management of YOLO-format annotations to support the EU-funded melanoma detection project. This tool increased annotation efficiency by 40% and reduced error rates by 25%.

The application was initially designed for the iToBoS skin lesion dataset but is adaptable to various object detection tasks, making it valuable for multiple medical imaging scenarios.
