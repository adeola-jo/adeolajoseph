Hi! I am currently a Senior Technician at the [ViCOROB Institute](https://vicorob.udg.edu/) in Girona, Spain, working on the European Commission-funded Horizon 2020 project "[Intelligent Total Body Scanner for Early Detection of Melanoma (iToBoS)](https://itobos.eu/)". My research focuses on computer vision and multi-robot coordination for medical applications, where I develop distributed control software and implement machine learning algorithms for lesion detection.

I completed my Erasmus Mundus Masters in Intelligent Robotic Systems at the University of Zagreb and University of Girona (2022-2024) and earned my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Ilorin, Nigeria (2016-2021). Prior to my current role, I worked as an AI Research Intern at the ViCOROB Institute (2023-2024) developing deep learning models for skin lesion detection, and as a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Ilorin (2021) automating data cleaning processes for physics research.

When I'm not working with robots, I'm actively involved in mentoring students through the Kingdom Scholars Community and serving on scholarship review committees. I'm also a passionate advocate for climate change awareness through my work with Save Sahara Network in Nigeria.

`At the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and healthcare, I've found my passion for creating technology that makes a tangible difference in people's lives. The challenges of medical robotics push me to continuously innovate and learn, while the potential impact keeps me motivated to overcome each obstacle.`

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
