Hi! I am currently a Senior Technician at the ViCOROB Institute in Girona, Spain, working on the European Commission-funded Horizon 2020 project for early melanoma detection. My research focuses on computer vision and multi-robot coordination for medical applications, where I develop distributed control software and implement machine learning algorithms for lesion detection.

I completed my Erasmus Mundus Masters in Intelligent Robotic Systems at the University of Zagreb and University of Girona (2022-2024) and earned my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Ilorin, Nigeria (2016-2021). Prior to my current role, I worked as an AI Research Intern at the ViCOROB Institute (2023-2024) developing deep learning models for skin lesion detection, and as a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Ilorin (2021) automating data cleaning processes for physics research.

### Research Interests
- Computer Vision and Image Processing
