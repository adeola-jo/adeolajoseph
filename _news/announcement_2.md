### About the Challenge

The iToBoS 2024 Skin Lesion Detection Challenge brought together researchers and engineers from around the world to develop innovative solutions for automated detection of pigmented skin lesions, with a particular focus on early melanoma detection. This competition was organized as part of the European Commission-funded Horizon 2020 project "Intelligent Total Body Scanner for Early Detection of Melanoma (iToBoS)."

### Challenge Results

After months of intense competition, the winning teams demonstrated remarkable advancements in detection accuracy and efficiency. The top three teams achieved sensitivity rates exceeding 90% while maintaining high specificity, representing a significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art systems.

#### Winners

<ul>
    <li><strong>1st Place</strong>: Team DermAI (Technical University of Munich)</li>
    <li><strong>2nd Place</strong>: Team MelanomExplorer (University of Barcelona)</li>
    <li><strong>3rd Place</strong>: Team DeepDerm (Stanford University)</li>
</ul>

The winning solutions utilized novel approaches combining advanced computer vision techniques with innovative deep learning architectures specifically designed for medical image analysis.

### Award Ceremony

The awards ceremony took place on January 18, 2025, at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, a key partner in the iToBoS project. The event featured presentations from the winning teams, demonstrations of their solutions, and discussions about the future of AI in dermatology.

> "The solutions developed during this challenge will help shape the future of automated skin cancer detection and have the potential to save countless lives through earlier diagnosis."
> —Dr. Josep Malvehy, Scientific Coordinator of the iToBoS project

### Impact and Future Work

The algorithms developed during this challenge will be considered for integration into the iToBoS system, potentially enhancing its detection capabilities. The success of this competition highlights the importance of collaborative efforts in advancing medical imaging technology and improving patient outcomes.

We would like to thank all participants for their outstanding contributions to this field and their dedication to improving melanoma detection through technology.
